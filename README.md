# Equal-Weight NIFTY 500 Index Fund

The goal of this projrct is to create a Python script that will accept the value of your portfolio and tell you how many shares of each NIFTY 500 constituent you should purchase to get an equal-weight version of the index fund.

## Installation

pip install nsetools

Our final result will be an excel sheet giving us the number of shares we should buy of each stock of the NIFTY 500 Index.
